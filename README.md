# Climate Weather Sim
A very simplistic weather and climate simulator for worldbuilding. Currently in the process of converting the project from python (ClWxSim-py) to C (C_ClWxSim).

Note, conversion is still incomplete at this time.

## Current Features
- Basic Win32API ui
- Graph showing air pressure and wind velocity

## Inprogress Features
- Pressure Advection and Diffusion

## Future Features
- Wind Simulation
- Coriolis Effect
- Pressure Gradient Force Simulation
- Temperature Calculation, using ideal gas laws and the Pressure Simulation
- Humidity Simulation, including Precipitation and Cloud tracking
- Advanced UI with front tracking and views for humidity, temperatures, pressure, wind etc
- Ability to input any Planet map into the simulation
- Simulation state storage and continuation
